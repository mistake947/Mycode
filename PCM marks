Sort the students in Ascending order of their Physics marks.
Once this is done, sort the students having same marks in Physics in the descending order of their Chemistry marks.
Once this is also done, sort the students having same marks in Physics and Chemistry in the ascending order of their Maths marks.



we first need to create a mapping between all 3 marks of a student.
for that I have used a vector of size 3.

then sort it.
Use a comparator function to sort.. comparison will be happening between 2 vectors of length 3.

Finally, map the sorted values back to each array as it is a void function.

Logic for comparator :-

If
physics marks different, ascending
else
if chemistry marks different, descending
else
maths marks ascending.

code:-

static bool cmp(vector<int> a, vector<int> b)
{
if(a[0] == b[0])
{
if(a[1] == b[1])
{
return a[2] < b[2];
}
else
return a[1] > b[1];
}
else
return a[0] < b[0];
}
void customSort (int phy[], int chem[], int math[], int N)
{
// your code here
vector<vector<int>> res;
for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)
{
vector<int> temp;
temp.push_back(phy[i]);
temp.push_back(chem[i]);
temp.push_back(math[i]);
res.push_back(temp);
}

sort(res.begin(), res.end(), cmp);
for(int i = 0; i < res.size(); i++)
{
phy[i] = res[i][0];
chem[i] = res[i][1];
math[i] = res[i][2];
}
}
